# Linear Dynamical Systems Tutorial
Code for the Stanford Computational Neuroscience Journal Club's meeting on linear dynamical systems. Notebook is in code/LDS_Basics.ipynb.

Go to tinyurl.com/linear4lyfe to see a live version of the notebook (thanks mybinder.org).

If you want to run the fitting examples locally, install the SSM library (https://github.com/slinderman/ssm) and download the worm data from [this S3 link (30.6 MB)](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stanford-cnjc-files/2019/feb/session_01/N2+on+food+L_2010_04_08__11_25_23___8___1_featuresN.hdf5). Leave the filename as is and move it to the `data/` directory.
