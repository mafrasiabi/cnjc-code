# cnjc-code
CNJC meetings can be accompanied by code snippets, notebooks, or other GitHub-friendly content. This repo exists to 1) catalogue materials used in sessions and 2) allow CNJC members to explore the snippets in their free time.

## Structure
`meetings` organizes content for each meeting, each directory within `meetings` should be labeled like `YYYY_MM_[short description of topic]`

The contents of each meeting's specific directory can be whatever the presenters for that session deem useful or interesting!
